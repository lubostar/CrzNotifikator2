# CRZ Notifikator 2.0

This is an Android project, client on data from https://ekosystem.slovensko.digital/otvorene-api#crz, which have origin in crz.gov.sk.

Goals of the project are:

    browse and search data online (thin client)
    optionally download all or only selected data from server into internal database (fat client)
    user can define a filter; if a filter is defined, then the app will check in 24h intervals through thin client whether there is a new item in data set corresponding to the filter; if there is at least one such item, the app will show a notification about it to the user

Project will be implemented in Kotlin and in MVVM architecture.

I invite anyone who wish to help with the project.
